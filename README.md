In this repo you will find everything you need to know about how I went on implementing the task.
Starting from ideation phase to implementation and deployment in the end.

### Ideation phase

In this image you can see what was my tought proccess during the ideation phase:

- Firstly copied the tasks to be done in order to see them more clearly
- Afterwards decided what routes should the app have
- Broke down the routes into components
- Decided what things I should take into consideration while developing
- Finally broke down the main task into smaller ones
